# Hangman-Game
This is a Python implementation of the classic Hangman game. It selects a random word from an external `words.py` file and challenges the player to guess it by inputting letters. The player has 7 lives, with incorrect guesses resulting in lost lives. The game shows your progress and a cool hangman visual using hangman_visual.py. Enjoy!
